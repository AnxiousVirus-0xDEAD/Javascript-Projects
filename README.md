# My JavaScript (and HTML/CSS) Projects

Welcome to my digital playground! This repository is where I'm storing all the code I've created during my web development course.  You'll find a collection of projects, ranging from simple scripts to (hopefully) hilarious web applications.  Buckle up, and enjoy the ride!

## What's Inside

This repo includes:

* JavaScript projects (of course!)
* HTML and CSS files (because you can't have a website without them)
* Any other code-related experiments I've cooked up.

I'll be updating this repository regularly as I progress through the course, so stay tuned for more code-tastic creations!
